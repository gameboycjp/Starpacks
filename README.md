# Starpacks
Creates modpacks for Starbound using symlinking and minimal file copying.

Should now work on Windows! I left debug logging in for now but once I test Linux I'll fix things up.

Workshop mods must be a contents.pak for now. If you know any mods that are more than just a .pak, please open an issue and pass a link over! I do not know of any mods that are like that on the workshop.

### TODOs

Bug fixes, UX improvements, and new features, like external mod symlinking, and perhaps workshop downloading for GOG.

I gotta make a GUI for this thing too.

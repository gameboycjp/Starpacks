# Starpacks
Creates modpacks for Starbound using symlinking and minimal file copying. Should be baseline functional on Linux, Windows support is still nonfunctional for now but the program should at least finish running assuming it didn't hit any snags.

Workshop mods must be a contents.pak for now. If you know any mods that are more than just a .pak, please open an issue and pass a link over! I do not know of any mods that are like that on the workshop.

### TODOs

Bug fixes, UX improvements, and new features, like external mod symlinking, and perhaps workshop downloading for GOG.

I gotta make a GUI for this thing too.

# Starpacks
Creates modpacks for Starbound using symlinking and minimal file copying. Untested and untouched since 2021, but I wanted to get the code publicized before working on it any more.


TODO: I should test to make sure everything still works, and make sure it functions on Windows, because it probably doesn't. Otherwise, UX improvements, like an external mod symlink system.

TODO2: I gotta make a GUI for this thing too.

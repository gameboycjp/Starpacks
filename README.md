# Starpacks
Creates modpacks for Starbound using symlinking and minimal file copying.

Should now work on both Windows and Linux. Now patched to actually use the workshop path.

Also remember to run as Admin on Windows! They block off symlinks without it, it's a pretty stupid limitation. Linux can run as user.

Workshop mods must be a contents.pak for now. If you know any mods that are more than just a .pak, please open an issue and pass a link over! I do not know of any mods that are like that on the workshop.

### TODOs

Bug fixes, UX improvements, and new features, like external mod symlinking, and perhaps workshop downloading for GOG.

I gotta make a GUI for this thing too.

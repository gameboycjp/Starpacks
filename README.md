# Starpacks
Creates modpacks for Starbound using symlinking and minimal file copying.

Should now work on both Windows and Linux.

Also remember to run as Admin on Windows! They block off symlinks without it, it's a pretty stupid limitation. Linux can run as user.

Should be widely compatible with most mods now! If you know of any mods on the workshop that are folders, open an issue and link me the mod so I can test myself. Theoretically it should work fine with those too without any fuss.

### TODOs

Bug fixes, UX improvements, and new features, like external mod symlinking, and perhaps workshop downloading for GOG.

I gotta make a GUI for this thing too.

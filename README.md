# Starpacks
Creates modpacks for Starbound using symlinking and minimal file copying. Untested and untouched since 2022, but I wanted to get the code publicized before working on it any more.

### TODOs

I should test to make sure everything still works, and fix it for Windows. Otherwise, UX improvements and new features, like an external mod symlink system.

I gotta make a GUI for this thing too.
